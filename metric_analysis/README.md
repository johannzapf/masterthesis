# Metric Analysis

This directory contains the following files:
- [evaluation_judges.py](evaluation_judges.py) contains the code to create the sample datasets and run the different metric variants on them
- The four *eval-judges-[...].csv* datasets are the samples for WikiEval and sovanta and for retrieval and generation that contain the computed versions of the various metrics
- The two notebooks [compare_judges_ret.ipynb](compare_judges_ret.ipynb) and [compare_judges_gen.ipynb](compare_judges_gen.ipynb) present the resulting correlations
